# ink-typescript-redux-test

### Wat?
This is a test project for using [ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) with
[TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)
and
[redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)

There's a pretty basic `Provider` element
(like from [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux))
, which just gives the child components
some context and subscribes to the store to call forceUpdate() when the state updates, which forces a re-render.

### How?
1. clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/xdave/ink-typescript-redux-test.git`
2. `cd ink-typescript-redux-test`
3. `npm start` or `yarn start`
4. look at the code
5. write some cool CLI apps
6. ...
7. profit!?
